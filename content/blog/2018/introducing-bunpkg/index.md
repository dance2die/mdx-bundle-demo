Michael Jackson on [React Podcast Episode 19](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/19) shared his professional experiences.

He created [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/) to solve a problem.

UNPKG has been used by many and I wanted to solve one, which is to make it easy to build script tags easily for UNPKG.

Here comes [Bunpkg](https://bunpkg.com/).

## ‚ùì What?

Bunpkg (_pronounced "Bun Package", meaning B{uild} unpkg {URL}_) is for generating an UNPKG script tag.

Here is Bunpkg in action.

## ü§î Why?

As mentioned above, it's to make it easy to generate UNPKG script tags and for me to _learn continuously_.

I plan to learn & and use [Redis](https://redis.io/), [CloudFlare API](https://api.cloudflare.com/), and [Progressive Web Apps](https://redis.io/) to make a continuous improvement.

I've read UNPKG & [BundlePhobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) source code generously shared by [Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson) & [Shubham Kanodia](https://github.com/pastelsky)
