_**Note to self...**_

This week's Weekend Reads in [r/reactjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs) was for¬†[Optimizing Performance](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html).

An ah-ha moment when reading the article regarding immutability.

Suppose that you have a component, `Post` that has to render a comment thread like this.

_Reddit Post:_ [_What's a joke that's so stupid it's funny?_](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a26y06/whats_a_joke_thats_so_stupid_its_funny/)

Reddit Comments

And the state tree would look like below.

Post state tree

When JavaScript compares two values, primitive type (number, string, boolean, etc) comparisons shown in the state tree, such as `id`, `date`, `author`, are cheap.

When you have to compare object type states, a comparison is done _**by reference**_.

So if someone has modified one of the items in `comments` array, you have to traverse every item in the comment to find out if anything has changed.

It's an `O(n)` operation process thus it's slow ü¶Ñ.

But if you had returned a new `comments` array (using Object.assign or object spread, {...}) then reference has changed, thus you know that something has changed.

Now it's an `O(1)` operation, blazing fast üèé.

## TIL

If your state is immutable, then React can reconcile which state to update cheaply.

You can still override [shouldComponentUpdate](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate) if you need need more control.
