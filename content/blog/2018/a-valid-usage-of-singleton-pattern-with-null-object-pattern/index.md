Singleton has a bad rep for being an anti-pattern. You might have been burned bad with it.

I learned from [Michael Outlaw](https://www.codingblocks.net/author/outlaw/) from [Coding Blocks podcast episode 16](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/episode-16-design-patterns-part-2-oh-behave/) that [Singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) can come in handy in conjunction with [Null object pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern).

Let's dive in.

### Why implement a Null object as a singleton?

42 minutes into the Coding Blocks Episode 16, Michael Outlaw explains two reasons.

1. "If you have two versions of null objects, they should be identical, why waste memory to have same nothingness repeated".
2. For equality checks - Each null object can be compared by reference.

Depending on a situation you might not even need to do a equality check as a null object usually does nothing (as you can see in the [example](#example) section below.)

**TL;DR** - You can stop reading here.

### Example

Here is an example of how you can use a Singleton pattern with a Null object pattern.

Suppose that there is a simple factory (PaymentStrategyFactory) that returns a strategy object instance for processing a payment given a provider name.

PayPal & ApplePay strategies return "Successful" or "Failed" process status at random.

`gist:dance2die/496655cf6ec63b4dd74da93c4e6e180b`

If a provider name is not supported, the `PaymentStrategyFactory` simply returns an object of type `NullPaymentStrategy`, which implements `IPaymentStrategy`.

Singleton instance is achieved with a private constructor and a static `Instance` property.

Let's put them together and process payments.

Results of `ProcessPayments()`.

### Conclusion

Googling [Singleton Anti Pattern](https://www.google.com/search?q=singleton+anti+pattern) results in many reasons why Singleton pattern is bad.

But when used judiciously, it can improve your code quality/memory/speed.
