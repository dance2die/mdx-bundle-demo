You might run into the following error after deploying a single page React site using React Router to Netlify.

Error message on Netlify

## How did the error occur?

React Router handles routing on the client side (browser) so when you visit non-root page (e.g. `https://yoursite.netlify.com/else`), Netlify (server-side) does not know how to handle the route.  
_(As your routes are set up in the root level)._

## Error Code & Demo

Here is the simplest code using React Router.

And the error occurring on Netlify when you go to `https://<netlify domain>/else` directly.

Page Not Found Demo

## How can we fix it?

Netlify offers a special file, [\_redirects](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/), which you can add to your code base and let Netlify handle how to handle the URL that is not handled on the client-side.

_Netlify documentation has a section,_ [_History Pushstate and Single Page Apps_](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/#history-pushstate-and-single-page-apps)_, which shows you how to redirect to the root of your SPA URL (but doesn't mention React Router, as it applies to other client-side frameworks/libraries)._

So to fix the issue, we need to create a file named `_redirects` to the root of your site with following content.

\_redirect static file

_Change _`_index.html_`_ accordingly to match the SPA root._

Here is the [working site](https://react-router-v4-to-deploy-to-netlify-with-redirects.netlify.com/else).

Netlify successfully redirected to the SPA root
