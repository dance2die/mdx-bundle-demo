Installed [Kubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://kubuntu.org/) (KDE version of Ubuntu) on my old laptop.  

Had a bit of trouble setting up Korean input so decided to share here.

I will use KDE GUI for the majority of the tasks here.

## Table of Contents

1. Install Korean
1. Install [ibus-hangul](https://github.com/libhangul/ibus-hangul)
1. Configure ibus
1. Autostart ibus-daemon
1. Trying out Korean input

## 1. Install Korean

1. Go to Application Launcher, and search & select "Language"
    ![1.1](./images/1.1.jpg)
1. Click on "Add languages..." button
1. Select Korean (한국어) & click on "Add" button
    ![1.2-3](./images/1.2-3.jpg)

Now Korean is available in your system so let's move on and install `ibus-hangul`, which supports Korean input.

## 2. Install ibus-hangul

Quick and easy way is to install `ibus-hangul` is via `apt` command,

```bash
sudo apt install ibus-hangul
```

Let's now configure `ibus` to work with Korean next.

## 3. Configure ibus

1. Go to Application Launcher, and search & select "Ibus Preferences"
    ![3.1](./images/3.1.jpg)
    - You will see that the default "Next input method" is `<Super>space`
    ![5.1](./images/5.1.jpg)
    - `<Super>` is the "Windows" key on your keyboard
    - So you can press `Windows + space` to switch between English & Korean
1. Go to "Input Method" tab, and click on "Add" button
1. Find and select Korean (한국어) and click on "Add" button, and close the preferences dialog
    ![3.2](./images/3.2.jpg)

You might get prompted to start `ibus-daemon` when you opened "Ibus Preferences".  
It's a one-off execution, so when you restart your machine, you'd need to start the `ibus-daemon` manually.  

As it's a pain, let's autostart the daemon on log on.

## 4. Autostart ibus-daemon

1. Go to Application Launcher, and search & select "Autostart"
    ![4.1](./images/4.1.jpg)
1. Click on "Add Program" button and then "Open file dialog" button
    ![4.2](./images/4.2.jpg)
1. In the "Name" field, add `/usr/bin/ibus-daemon` & click "Open" button
    ![4.3](./images/4.3.jpg)
1. Click "OK" to close "Choose Application" dialog, which then opens "Properties for ibus-daemon-desktop" dialog, automatically
    ![4.4](./images/4.4.jpg)
1. Go to "Application" tab and add `-d` in the "Command" to start the daemon in the background.
    - "Command" field should be `/usr/bin/ibus-daemon -d`
      ![4.5.1](./images/4.5.1.jpg)
    - You will now see the command under "Desktop File"
      ![4.5.2](./images/4.5.2.jpg)
1. Save and close with "OK" button

⚠ At this point you need to restart your machine.

## 5. Trying out Korean input

After you restarting the machine, open up a browser and press `<Super>space` to change the language to Korean.  

![5.2](./images/5.2.jpg)  

At this point, we haven't set the default language for Korean input to be Korean.  You can start using Korean after pressing `shift + space`.  
You can change the default keyboard binding in the preferences screen.


![5.3](./images/5.3.jpg)  
![5.4](./images/5.4.jpg)  

You should now be able to type in Korean (I am using VS Code below)
