I've [heard][podcast] and [read][book] about Deliberate Practice but never paid attention to it.

After coming across James Clear (of [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) fame), I decided to read through his articles and summarize them to learn.

## What is Deliberate Practice?

It's a subset of practice, which is both "purposeful and systematic".

_Reference: [Deliberate Practice: What It Is and How to Use It][definition]_

> While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.

_Reference: [The Beginner’s Guide to Deliberate Practice][beginner]_

## What it is not

Deliberate Practice doesn't mean you can do anything with enough time and effort. Genetics "influence performance, [but] they do not _determine_ performance".

- _Reference: [The Beginner’s Guide to Deliberate Practice][beginner]_
- _Reference: [The Myth and Magic of Deliberate Practice][myth]_

## Purposeful

Being "purposeful" means having focused attention during practice.

## Systematic

The biggest difference between a "simple repetition" and the Deliberate Practice is the "feedback".  
There are two ways to get feedback.

1. Measurement (Effective): You need to quantify your success and track the progress. Examples include,
   1. Number of pages read in a book
   1. Pushup count (during a workout)
   1. Sales call count
1. Coaching: One cannot perform a task and measure at the same time
   - Coaches can find "small ways to improve"
   - Holds you accountable (for mistakes or not keeping up, etc)

## Layering Skills

In "What it is not" section above, genetics doesn't determine performance.  
James Clear talks about how Scott Adams, an average artist, and a run-of-the-mill jokester became successful.

- _Reference: [The Myth and Magic of Deliberate Practice][myth]_

What Scott did was to combine two skills (drawing + writing jokes), which is a rare quality.  
_OP's Note: this struck me hard_
