I've coded for fun last year to learn how to make Web API calls using C#. The library access [MyAnimeList.net API](https://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api) and the project is called [MyAnimeListSharp](https://github.com/dance2die/MyAnimeListSharp), which I never thought anyone would use.

![](./images/MAL.jpg)As a background information, MyAnimeList is a well known community/website for searching Japanese Anime (animation) or Manga (cartoon) as well as maintaining your Manga/Anime viewing list.

A few days ago, someone ([onilink128](https://github.com/onilink128)) has created an issue for the project I haven't touched over a year.Â That person reported a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dance2die/MyAnimeListSharp/issues/3) that the library stopped working. I was a bit confused initially that someone was actually using my library. After a few moments later, I was feeling pleasure from the issue even though it was about reporting a problem in my code. I was just glad that someone has actually tried to use the code I wrote publicly. I've gotten back the motivation I've lost to work on that project a year ago.

I've newly found a motivation to keep myself to keep programming. It's funny how a problem often causes me to look forward to what's coming next.
