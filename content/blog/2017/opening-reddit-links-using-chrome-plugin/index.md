It was Saturday night. I had a lot of time on my hands so I decided to browse [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

Reddit has so many links, clicking on each link manually was a burden to my hands and wasn't time efficient.

I decided to automate opening each link.

As mentioned, the first problem is that, I had to manually click each link on a page.

So I wrote a simple JavaScript to open links in Chrome developer console.

But [Chrome prevents JavaScript from opening multiple tabs](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16757736/4035). So I used Internet Explorer, which allows JavaScript to open multiple tabs.

A problem occurred when I went to other Sub-Reddits in a new tabs. I had to open developer console again and paste JavaScript.

I found out that Chrome Plugin allows opening multiple tabs using JavaScript. After implementing a [simple plugin](https://github.com/dance2die/Chrome.Plugin.OpenRedditLinks), I was able to open links with a click of a button.

The last problem is that, I didn't want to click the plugin every time. So I decided to bind the plugin with a keyboard shortcut.

Now I can open all links with a keyboard shortcut, `Ctrl+Alt+F`.

### Conclusion

I was able to browse Reddit much faster than I could have had than clicking on each link manually.

There is already a Chrome plugin called [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) (RES), which was pointed out by "Aaron C" on Coding Blocks Slack Channel.
