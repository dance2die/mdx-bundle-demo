I've read a book, How to Win Friends and Influence People (the Friends book), recently and wondered about the phrase, "be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise"

I've tried to apply what I learned but never understood "why" it'd help to win friends.

[kirillVv](https://github.com/kirillVv) reported an [issue (InvalidOperationException by anime Search) ](https://github.com/dance2die/MyAnimeListSharp/issues/4)for one of the library I created on GitHub.

I've fixed the issue and notify the reporter to try it out and S/he was able to get the program working fine. But then kirillVv thanked me about the update made as well as for the library. S/he simply thanked me for creating the library but I felt something warm and fuzzy inside.

And then it hit me and felt enlightened. I was reminded of the phrase in the Friends book and thought that "this was why"... It'd be simply a manipulation should the appreciation came from with another objective in mind. But his/her comment really sounded as if it came from the true gratitude (or maybe I thought about it that way).

For some reason, I've wanted to pay more attention to what "kirillVv" does on GitHub and probably would put more priority on issues that kirillVv reports.

### Conclusion

I've learned that showing appreciation to others for their efforts and help would greatly increase the relationship with those you thank. It doesn't have to be monetary compensation to win others but a simply "Thank You" is enough sometimes.
