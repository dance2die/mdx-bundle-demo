Let's deploy a `create-react-app` generated site on Netlify.

After signing in to Netlify, click on **New Site from Git** on the top right.

Click on **GitHub** button to choose a repository to deploy. It will prompt you for GitHub access.

You can give Netlify only a public repo access by clicking on the checkbox below "GitHub" button.

Filter by repo name and "pick a repository" by clicking on a repo returned.

Set the basic settings for `create-react-app` site.

1. **Build command** - `yarn build` or `npm run build`
2. **Publish directory** - `build`
