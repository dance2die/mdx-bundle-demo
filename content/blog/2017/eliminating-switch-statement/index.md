I was solving [Make the Deadfish Swim](https://www.codewars.com/kata/make-the-deadfish-swim/) on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com), which seemed to require many if or switch (conditional) statements.

I was impressed with two Functional Programming in Javascript articles ([Rethinking JavaScript: The if statement](https://hackernoon.com/rethinking-javascript-the-if-statement-b158a61cd6cb) & [Rethinking JavaScript: Eliminate the switch statement for better code](https://hackernoon.com/rethinking-javascript-eliminate-the-switch-statement-for-better-code-5c81c044716d)), by [Joel Thoms](https://hackernoon.com/@joelthoms) so I wanted to give it a try without conditional statements.

What was involved to solve the question without `switch`?

### TL;DR

> Use a dictionary & a lambda expression

### Question?

[Make the Deadfish Swim](https://www.codewars.com/kata/make-the-deadfish-swim/) is about parsing a string of commands and perform operations on an initial value of 0.

> Write a simple parser that will parse and run Deadfish. Deadfish has 4 commands, each 1 character long. 'i' will increment the value ( initially 0 ). 'd' will decrement the value. 's' will square the value. 'o' will output the value into the return array.

 

> Invalid characters should be ignored.
> 
> `Deadfish.Parse("iiisdoso") => new int[] {8, 64};`

At a glance, a simple `ifs` or a  `switch` would be required to solve it.

Let's implement it using a `switch` statement.

### "With" Switch

`gist:dance2die/638139dd386ec7a3b806327aa470911a`

Iterative version **matches** against each command and performs **operations**.

`cmd` is a character in `data`, which is `"iiisdoso"` in the question.

The code **iterates** each command and operate on the `sum`.

### How do we get rid of the switch statement?

We want to rid `switch` and there are two aspects to consider.

1. What'd be a good **Data Structure** (DS) for **matching** and getting a value?
2. How do  **operate** on a value?

For the first question, a hashtable/dictionary is a good fit because the time complexity for a key lookup is `O(1)`.

For the latter, [a lambda/anonymous function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions) would do the job. (I am using C#, which provides [Func<T, TResult>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549151(v=vs.110).aspx)).

We all the pieces in place, let's look at the version without the `switch` statement.

### "Without" Switch

`gist:dance2die/067a741bca0d2bce5024567e05eb8e2a`

The first thing I did was to create a [dictionary](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508(v=vs.110).aspx), `commands` for a fast lookup.

And for the operation (values of `commands`), a lambda expression (which accepts an integer and returns an integer) is used.

`data` operates on each character (command) and operates on the `value`using [**Select**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb548891(v=vs.110).aspx) LINQ statement.

### Why?

First of all, why would I want to eliminate `switch`?

Instead of instructing **how** a problem needs to be solved, FP requires you to think in terms of **what** to solve.

I could've gone the whole nine yards and used a [Command Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) but it seemed like Object Oriented Programming trying to emulate Functional Programming (FP).

And also the problem is small enough to dabble with FP.

### Parting Words

I am just getting started with FP way of writing programs in C# and started using LINQ heavily.

Still wrapping my head around on FP so I'd appreciate it if you can provide me pointers on how to go further with FP.
