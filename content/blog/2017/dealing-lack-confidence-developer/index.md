I've been in a slump where I feel like I've been doing the same thing 3 times last 9 years at the same job, thus feeling like having only 3 years of experience.

I've been having a lack of confidence as a developer trying to keep up with all these new technologies, especially in front-end area where there is a deluge of JavaScript technologies (refer to this [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/) post on "[How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.t7dg2iuk2)".)

I found this YouTube video by John Sonmez ([Simple Programmer](https://simpleprogrammer.com)) and I'd like to share what I've learned to do.

In this video, "[Dealing With Lack Of Confidence As A Developer](https://youtu.be/KmimOJIR0zE)", John talks about what you should do to deal with your lack of confidence and also narrates his experience.

The gist of the content is that, everyone takes jobs they are not prepared for. Don't give up until you make it. You will get used to the uncomfortable situation when you face it.

Then, John says something that made me feel guilty." At [3:35](https://youtu.be/KmimOJIR0zE?t=3m35s), Â he says that a lot of his old co-workers have been "doing the same thing for the last 10 or 15 years". To get around the problem, he suggested to constantly put yourself in an uncomfortable situations.

He ends his video mentioning that if you aim for your goal and you will achieve it.

I will shoot the moon, and hit the moon.
