_Note to self on how to get DOM content from Chrome Extension_

As I was building a Chrome Extension, [Easy GitHub](https://github.com/dance2die/easy-github) to generate I had to get DOM content on a GitHub page to see if it's a forked page or not.

Easy GitHub is to display initially a way to sync forked repository with the master repository.

Reference [Paul Seal](https://twitter.com/CodeSharePaul)'s blog - [How to keep your fork up to date with the master repository in GitHub](https://codeshare.co.uk/blog/how-to-keep-your-fork-up-to-date-with-the-master-repository-in-github/)

For forked GitHub page, GitHub page contains a meta tag named `octolytics-dimension-repository_parent_nwo` , which contains the parent repository the current repository is forked from.

But if the current page is not a fork repo page, then it doesn't have `octolytics-dimension-repository_parent_nwo` but have to use `go-import` meta value.

As a last resort, I needed to use `window.location.href`(or show a message that it's not a repo page in Chrome Extension popup).

When using `document.getElementBy*` or `document.querySelector*` within Chrome Extension, it fetches DOM for the extension HTML files, not from the tab content.

So to retrieve DOM content, one need to [execute](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#method-executeScript) a script within a tab by sending a query (`document.querySelector*` or `document.getElement*`) like following.

Execute Script within a Tab to extract DOM content

[_Source code_](https://github.com/dance2die/easy-github/blob/master/src/page_action/popup.js#L50) _on GitHub._

You can see above that, you pass a `code` to query DOM elements and extract URLs, which you can use to create a git command script.

You can add a [tabs permission](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs) to `execute` the script but it can be too detrimental thus you can simply add URLs to allow script executions.
