When you trying to get a DOM content in Chrome tab from an extension using `document.getElementBy*` or `document.querySelector*`, you get the DOM content of your extension HTML.

Suppose that you have a following default popup (specified as `page_action -> default_popup` in `manifest.json`).  
And select the `h1` content in `popup.js` referenced in `page_option.html`.

page_option.html

Then instead of getting the current DOM content displayed in the Chrome tab, it returns the DOM of the `page_option.html` instead.

What's returned

## ðŸ¤” Workaround?

So what you need to do is to request Chrome to [execute](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#method-executeScript) a document query command on your behalf.

popup.js

First you get the currently active Tab's ID (`tabId`).

_Refer to_ [_Chrome extension tutorial â€“ access active page dom_](https://infoheap.com/chrome-extension-tutorial-access-dom/) _on how that works._

Then you execute a code on the current tab (line #9). and the callback gives you `result` which is the result of `document.querySelector`.

If you want need to execute multiple queries, just put them in an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE).

Using IIFE to run multiple queries

## Parting Words

I've learned about it recently while writing a Chrome extension, [Easy GitHub](https://github.com/dance2die/easy-github) (work-in-progress).

You can see the relevant code snippets [here on GitHub](https://github.com/dance2die/easy-github/blob/master/src/page_action/popup.js).
