I've released [@cshooks/usetrie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cshooks/usetrie).

It's a React Hook for [Typeahead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeahead)/autocompletion.

[@cshooks/hooks](https://github.com/cshooks/hooks) will be the home üè† of Computer Science data structures/algorithms related hooks.

## ü§î Why?

When you have a list of texts you want to match by prefix, you have to match each text in an array one by one, which can be time consuming.

[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) is a data structure, which stores text in a tree, which enables a fast prefix look up.  
And `useTrie` works as a [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) to enable fast prefix search.

## üîß How?

Check out the [README](https://github.com/cshooks/hooks/blob/master/packages/useTrie/README.md) file, which explains the usage in detail.

Here are some quick demo Sandboxes for the impatients.

## ‚ûï Additional Info

I've created this initially for academic purposes to learn Trie data structure so `Trie` class is imperative and `useTrie` hook was forced to fit to work with declarative nature of React as shown below, which is not ideal.

add/remove returns a new instance

I'd really appreciate any feedback on how I can improve the code base.

I will share in the next post what I've learned and failures.

And I plan to add other hooks returning [Min/Max heaps](https://github.com/cshooks/hooks/projects/1) & [Permutations](https://github.com/cshooks/hooks/projects/2).
