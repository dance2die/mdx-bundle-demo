I've had a problem where I was trying to display an Emoji in a Chrome Extension header of default popup HTML, `page_action.html` (specified by `page_action -> default_popup` in `manifest.json`).

But got the jumbled up characters instead.

Emoji displayed as gobbledygook

The problem was that I had to instruct Chrome that I am using a unicode by adding a charset meta tag.

Character Set set to UTF-8  

This has fixed the issue and shows the cute 🐥 emoji correctly in the Chrome Extension popup.

You can now see the cute baby chick 🐥
