## A Zero-configuration CLI (command line interface) for creating a TypeScript library

After migrating [react-use-localstorage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-localstorage) to [TSDX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsdx), I wanted to share what TSDX is and how to use it.

It's pretty cool as it simplified the workflow & scripts within package.json.

Instead of writing a long-@$$ post, I decided to create a video instead.

I'd recommend to watch it at 1.0x+ speed as I was talking very slowly (making funny faces along the way ðŸ˜¨).

You can find the MindMap used to show the steps here - [https://mm.tt/1283868109?t=FOjysY56kp](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmm.tt%2F1283868109%3Ft%3DFOjysY56kp&redir_token=8sngKKDyoQyb9khEhfB7Poq8HKR8MTU2MDgyMDU0OUAxNTYwNzM0MTQ5&v=YfF39o7MR7A&event=video_description)

I'd appreciate any feedbacks how I can improve the video recording as I haven't recorded any videos for years ðŸ˜‰
