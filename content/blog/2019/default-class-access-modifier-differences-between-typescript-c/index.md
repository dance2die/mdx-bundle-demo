Note to self...

TypeScript's class access modifiers are [public by default](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html#public-private-and-protected-modifiers) while it's [private in C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers#class-and-struct-accessibility).

Quite a surprise as TypeScript was created by [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg), who also created C#.

Can't seem to find any articles/posts behind "why" they are public by default in TypeScript ðŸ¤”...
